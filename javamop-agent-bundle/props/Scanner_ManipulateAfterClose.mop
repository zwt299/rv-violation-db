/**
 * Warns if a Closeable object, used in Scanner, is used after the Scanner
 * object is closed.
 *
 * A Scanner object can take a Closeable object, such as Readable, InputStream
 * and ReadableByteChannel, and uses it as input. When the Scanner object is
 * closed, the Closeable object is closed as well. Thus any further operations
 * on the Closeable object is prohibited.
 * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html
 *
 * This property warns if any method invocation on the Closeable object once
 * the object is passed to a Scanner object. This does not give false warning
 * during the execution of Scanner because the callsite is hidden in the
 * Scanner implementation.
 *
 * @severity error
